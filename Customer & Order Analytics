#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


-- #1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT
    COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- #2. How many of those orders were for an iphone?
SELECT
    COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

-- #3. Select the customer accout numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT
    DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id;

-- #4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT
    DISTINCT product,
    price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- #5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT
    product,
    sum(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue;

-- #6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue;

-- #7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
    COUNT(c.acctnum),
    AVG(quantity * price) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
